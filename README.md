# Hello-world  
This README.md is an example template that you can adapt when introducing a project. You can update the headings to match your needs, but the main purpose is to give an overview of the project, list the files included, describe the tools or code used, and explain how to run it. Think of this as documentation.

  ## Additional Information   

This section is for additional details—links, references, results, or how you applied what you learned. For now, I've used it to practice Markdown formatting:

**BOLD text**  

*Italics text*  

~~Strikethrough text~~  

***Bold and Italics text***
